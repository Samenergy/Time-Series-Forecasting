# üå´Ô∏è PM2.5 Time-Series Prediction with LSTM

This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 air pollution levels using time-series deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM-based models. Our best-performing model combines **Bidirectional LSTM**, **Layer Normalization**, **LeakyReLU**, and the **Nadam optimizer**, achieving robust results in forecasting air quality.

## üìä Problem Statement

Air pollution, specifically PM2.5 particles, poses a significant health risk. Accurate short-term forecasts can support better planning and health responses. This project aims to forecast PM2.5 values from multivariate time-series air quality data using deep learning.

## üß† Best Model Architecture

```python
model = Sequential([
    Bidirectional(LSTM(64, activation='tanh', return_sequences=True), input_shape=(seq_length, X_train_seq.shape[2])),
    LayerNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.25),

    LSTM(32, activation='tanh'),
    LayerNormalization(),
    Dropout(0.25),

    Dense(64, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.1),

    Dense(1)
])
```

**Optimizer:** `Nadam`
**Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error
**Final Training Loss (MSE):** `0.01288`
**Final Training RMSE:** `0.05796`
